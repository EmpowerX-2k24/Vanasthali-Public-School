Our women safety website is designed to empower women with essential resources and tools for their protection and well-being. It provides information on various government schemes aimed at supporting womenâ€™s safety and rights. We have also outlined fundamental rights to help women understand the legal protections available to them.

One of the key features of the website is an interactive map where users can search for any city and view its safety rating based on available data, helping them make informed decisions about their travel or relocation. Additionally, we offer a survey page where users can share their experiences and feedback to further improve the platform and contribute to the safety of others.

The website also features a dedicated gadgets section, showcasing the latest safety devices that women can purchase to enhance their personal security. From wearable safety alarms to GPS trackers, our curated list provides options for different needs and preferences.

Overall, our platform serves as a comprehensive hub for women, offering vital information, community engagement, and practical tools to ensure safety and confidence in everyday life.
